                        Diana is born at Park House, Sandringham. Given the full name Diana Frances Spencer birth, Diana
                        is
                        born into an aristocratic family with royal connections. Her parents, John Spencer and Frances
                        Ruth
                        Roche, both descended from nobility and her maternal grandmother, Ruth Roche, was a
                        lady-in-waiting
                        to the Queen Mother.</div>

                        Diana is 7-years-old when her parents get divorced. Both parents remarry: her mother in the same
                        year to Peter Shand Kydd and her father to Raine Spencer, Countess of Dartmoor. In Andrew
                        Morton’s
                        biography of Princess Diana, the future Princess is reported to have said: "I remember seeing my
                        father slap my mother across the face. I was hiding behind the door, and Mummy was crying. I
                        remember Mummy crying an awful lot".

                        Her parents' divorce, Diana later says, enables her to relate to other people who struggle with
                        their family. "The divorce helped me to relate to anyone else who is upset in their family life,
                        whether it be stepfather syndrome or mother or whatever, I understand it. Been there, done it,"
                        she
                        later reflects.</div>
